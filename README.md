# 📊 Sales Insights Dashboard – Power BI + MySQL + ETL

This project demonstrates a complete **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)** and **Business Intelligence** workflow. It uses dummy sales data to build a rich, interactive **Sales Dashboard** in Power BI, supported by a **MySQL database** backend.

---

## 🔍 Project Objective

To extract, transform, store, and visualize sales data for business decision-making using:

- ETL Pipeline
- MySQL as the database
- Power BI for analysis and visualization

---

## 📁 Project Workflow

### ✅ Step 1: Data Generation
- Dummy data generated using [Mockaroo](https://mockaroo.com/)
- Columns include:
  - Order ID
  - Timestamp
  - Product
  - Quantity
  - Price
  - Customer Region
  - Payment Method

### ✅ Step 2: Database Setup (MySQL)

```sql
CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS sales_db;
USE sales_db;

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS sales (
    order_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    timestamp DATETIME,
    product VARCHAR(100),
    quantity INT,
    price DECIMAL(10, 2),
    customer_region VARCHAR(50),
    payment_method VARCHAR(50)
);

## ✅ Step 3: Power BI Integration

- Connected **Power BI** directly to the **MySQL** database  
- Performed data cleaning and modeling within Power BI  
- Created dynamic visuals and interactive KPIs for effective data storytelling
